# django-learning
Learning Django, to get prepared to be able to build a web application developed as part of my NBCC Core Research Assistant position.
This project explores foundational web development using Django, focusing on routing, views, templates, and HTTP handling.
It supports research into accessibility, clean architecture, and rapid prototyping for inclusive digital solutions.
I’m using this framework  also to simulate and analyze common CTF (Capture The Flag) attack vectors — such as URL manipulation, query/header/cookie injection, and session hijacking.
I am participating in the 2025 Target/ Women in Cybersecurity Challenge
